Items to resolve:

    Integrate Backend Authentication:
        Connect the login page with the backend for user authentication. i.e Setting up API endpoints and handling secure data transmission.

    Test the Login Functionality:
        Perform both unit tests and user acceptance tests to ensure the login page works as intended across different devices and browsers.

    Implement Security Measures:
        Ensure that the login process is secured (i.e using HTTPS, protecting against SQL injection and cross-site scripting).

    Prepare for Deployment:
        Get the login page ready for deployment, including minifying code and optimizing performance.
